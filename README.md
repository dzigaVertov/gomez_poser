Blender 3D addon - Automatic rigging and skinning for grease pencil strokes

The addon fits a bezier curve to the stroke.  Adds a set of bbones to an armature, skins them to the stroke and exposes another set of bones to allow the user to pose the stroke and animate it.  

# TO DO:

## Correct a couple of bugs regarding the tangents on the extremes of the fitted curve
## Clean the stroke before the fitting to remove points that are too close to each other and could misguide the fitting algorithm. 
## Consider the posibility of setting the bbones parameters directly via the fitted curve.
